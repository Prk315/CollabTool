# purpose
This project is created for the course database and information systems, as seen in forl√¶sning 1 i am primarily using python combined with flask and postgresql. I have chosen to opt for using external templates for the calendar creation and such, since the frontend of this application isnt truly relevent to the course.

# for my fellow students

flask --app backend.app run         

is the command to run the application and please dont mess with the internal psql postres.

# Student Collaboration Tool
A Flask-based web application that helps student groups find optimal meeting times and manage project deadlines based on shared availability. Calendar data can be imported via `.ics` files.
